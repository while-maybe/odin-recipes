  <p>Chilli prawn linguine is a flavorful and spicy Italian-inspired dish that combines succulent prawns (shrimp) with a
    rich and tangy tomato sauce infused with a hint of chilli heat. The prawns are typically cooked with garlic, red
    chilli, and sometimes sugar snap peas, adding a pop of color and crunch to the dish.</p>
  <p>The linguine pasta is tossed with the spicy prawn mixture, creating a harmonious balance of textures and flavors.
    The dish is often finished with a squeeze of lemon juice, which adds a touch of brightness and acidity to cut
    through the richness of the sauce. Whether served as a quick weeknight meal or a dinner party main course, chilli
    prawn linguine is a crowd-pleasing and satisfying option thatâ€™s sure to delight.</p>

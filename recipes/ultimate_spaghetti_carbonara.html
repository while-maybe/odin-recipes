  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Spaghetti carbonara is an Italian main course consisting of spaghetti (long thin strands of pasta) with bacon and a
    creamy sauce made from eggs, Pecorino or Parmesan and black pepper. The dish is probably from Rome.</p>
  <p>Mostly it's salty, rich, peppery, and a bit smokey. It's such a simple recipe that you should taste the individual
    components; egg yolk, cured pork fat, salt, pepper, Parmigiano cheese.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li class="ingredients">100g pancetta</li>
    <li class="ingredients">50g pecorino cheese</li>
    <li class="ingredients">50g parmesan</li>
    <li class="ingredients">3 large eggs</li>
    <li class="ingredients">350g spaghetti</li>
    <li class="ingredients">2 plump garlic cloves, peeled and left whole</li>
    <li class="ingredients">50g unsalted butter</li>
    <li class="ingredients">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.</li>
    <li>Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind. Finely grate 50g pecorino cheese and
      50g parmesan
      and mix them together.</li>
    <li>Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly grated black pepper. Set
      everything
      aside.</li>
    <li>Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when the water comes back to the boil,
      cook at a
      constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).</li>
    <li>Squash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it.</li>
    <li>While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. Drop 50g unsalted butter into a
      large frying
      pan or wok and, as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic.</li>
    <li>Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden
      and crisp. The
      garlic has now imparted its flavour, so take it out with a slotted spoon and discard.</li>
    <li>Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a
      pasta fork or
      tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. Don’t worry if a little water drops in the pan as well (you
      want this to happen) and don’t throw the pasta water away yet.</li>
    <li>Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later.
    </li>
    <li>Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese.
      Using the tongs or
      a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn’t scramble,
      and everything is coated.</li>
    <li>Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do it). You don’t want
      it wet, just
      moist. Season with a little salt, if needed.</li>
    <li>Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or bowl. Serve immediately with
      a little
      sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper. If the dish does get a little dry before
      serving, splash in some more hot pasta water and the glossy sauciness will be revived.</li>
  </ol>
